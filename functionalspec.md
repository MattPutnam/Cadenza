Cadenza Functional Spec
===

Overview
---

Cadenza is a MIDI performance manager aimed at hardware synths, designed to make the process of programming cues for a musical fast and easy.  While MIDI is fairly ubiquitous and there are lots of different performance scenarios, the scope of Cadenza is focused on musical theatre, and will not include features designed specifically for other types of performance if they don't benefit MT.

Scenario
---

Bob is a classically trained pianist in college for engineering.  In his dorm room he has a decent (but not great) digital piano with a basic list of common orchestral and keyboard sounds.  One semester, his friend Suzie is the Musical Director for a musical on campus, needs a keyboardist, and asks Bob.  Bob happily accepts, but then he sees his part: it calls for all sorts of crazy sounds with lots of complicated splitting/layering, and nearly instantaneous changes between them.  Some of the required sounds are obvious and easy to achieve ("pizzicato strings", "trombone section"), but others are difficult to decipher and his keyboard certainly doesn't have them ("metalling shimmering bell synth", "VeloWah", and something just labeled "XV-F-44").

Confused, he asks Suzie what to do, and she recommends Apple Mainstage.  Looking it up, Bob sees that it's Mac OS only, and he only has a cheap Dell laptop that he got for free 2 years ago for winning the Science Olympiad in high school.  His budget barely covers the case of Top Ramen he's hoping will last the semester, much less a new MacBook.  He googles around and finds some forums for keyboardists, and the forum residents all rave about Ableton Live, though they barely listen to Bob's list of requirements and wax endlessly about "clip automation" and "MIDI note editing", whatever the hell those are.  Bob goes to the Ableton website and learns that while it runs on Windows, the full version is $750, and it seems like the cheaper versions cut out the features that he really needs, especially in the area of available sounds.

Somehow (*TODO--marketing department, fix this*) Bob hears about Cadenza.  The software is free, and it requires only a small expenditure to get up and running, so he downloads it.  However, he's still pretty new to all of this and doesn't know the terminology used in this field.
