QualmEdit is a collection of editors for Qualm software:

The motivation for these editors is that Qualm can be difficult and unwieldy
to configure.  In cases where the user needs only basic functionality, there
is a large amount of overhead that still needs to be put in the control file.
In cases where more complicated cues are needed, it can be difficult to
manage all of the different MIDI channels, triggers, and other data items in
the control file.

QualmText is a tool that allows the user to write Qualm control files in a
simplified language, called Qualm Simple Language (QSL).  Read QSL.txt for
information on its specification.  QualmText is then run on these files,
generating the standard Qualm XML file.  This solution is ideal for users
needing only basic functionality (single patches or simple splits) on small
projects, but is still somewhat unwieldy for larger or more complicated cases.

QualmEdit is a graphical part editor suitable for all but the most
complicated of applications.  It allows the user to easily manage their cues,
as well as the patches and triggers being used in them.
