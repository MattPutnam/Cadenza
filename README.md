Cadenza
=======

Cadenza is a live MIDI performance manager, designed specifically to handle the large number of patches (and quick patch changes) that most modern musicals call for.  It is optimized to minimize cost--the software is free to use, and it's designed to require as few outside purchases as possible.  If you already have a laptop capable of running Java and a keyboard with MIDI I/O, you're already almost there.  If the keyboard has USB MIDI, you just need a USB cable, otherwise you need a MIDI interface (for example the Roland UM-ONE at around $40).  For more sounds, I recommend picking up a Roland JV-1080, which can be found on eBay for around $200.  No MacBook Pro and ProTools, no expensive VST libraries, no specialty pedals.

This project requires my Common library as well.  If something doesn't compile, just poke me, I probably just forgot to push something to Common.
