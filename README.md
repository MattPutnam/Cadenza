Cadenza
=======

Cadenza is a live MIDI performance manager, designed specifically to handle the large number of patches (and quick patch changes) that most modern musicals call for.  It is designed to minimize cost--the software is free to use, and it's designed to require as few outside purchases as possible.  If you already have a laptop capable of running Java and a keyboard with MIDI I/O, you're already almost there.  If the keyboard has USB MIDI, you just need a USB cable, otherwise you need a MIDI interface (for example the Roland UM-ONE at around $40).  For more sounds, I recommend picking up a Roland JV-1080, which can be found on eBay for around $200.  No MacBook Pro and ProTools, no expensive VST libraries, no specialty pedals.

To install, copy the relevant .zip file out of the root directory to wherever (likely Program Files on Windows, Applications on Mac OS X, but it doesn't actually matter) and unzip it.  This results in a directory with the runnable .JAR and some other stuff inside.  The .JAR MUST be in the same directory as the "resources" subdirectory in order to work properly.

This project requires my Common library as well (for dev only, the zips are fully self-contained).  If something doesn't compile, just poke me, I probably just forgot to push something to Common.
